# SecureFinApp
This CS 305 final project implements multi-layered security for financial web applications, featuring vulnerability remediation, SHA-256 cryptographic verification, and HTTPS protocols. By applying defense-in-depth principles, I reduced security vulnerabilities from 144 to zero, demonstrating effective protection of sensitive financial data.
